Here's a review of your `sum` function:

❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){return a+b ;}
```

🔍 Issues:
*   ❌ **Global Variable Dependency:** The function implicitly relies on global variables `a` and `b`. This makes the function less predictable, harder to test, and prone to bugs if `a` or `b` are undefined, reassigned, or have unexpected types. Functions should ideally operate on explicit inputs.
*   ❌ **Lack of Reusability:** This function can only sum the specific global `a` and `b`, not arbitrary numbers provided by the caller.
*   ❌ **No Input Validation/Error Handling:** If `a` or `b` are not defined, are `null`, `undefined`, or non-numeric, the addition operation might result in a `ReferenceError`, `NaN`, or unexpected string concatenation, without clear feedback.

✅ Recommended Fix:
```javascript
/**
 * Calculates the sum of two numbers.
 * @param {number} a - The first number.
 * @param {number} b - The second number.
 * @returns {number | Error} The sum of a and b, or an Error if inputs are invalid.
 */
function sum(a, b) {
  if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
    // Optionally, you could also return NaN or throw a custom error
    throw new Error('Inputs must be numbers.');
  }
  return a + b;
}

// Example usage:
// console.log(sum(5, 3)); // 8
// try {
//   console.log(sum('hello', 3));
// } catch (e) {
//   console.error(e.message); // Inputs must be numbers.
// }
```

💡 Improvements:
*   ✔ **Explicit Parameters:** `a` and `b` are now passed as arguments, making the function self-contained, predictable, and highly reusable.
*   ✔ **Input Validation:** Checks if the inputs are actually numbers, preventing unexpected behavior or `NaN` results.
*   ✔ **Improved Reusability:** The function can now be used to sum any two numbers provided as arguments.
*   ✔ **Documentation (JSDoc):** Added a JSDoc block to clearly describe what the function does, its parameters, and what it returns, enhancing readability and maintainability.

Final Note:
Always strive to make your functions pure (given the same input, they always return the same output and have no side effects) and explicit about their dependencies. This significantly improves maintainability, testability, and reduces potential bugs.
